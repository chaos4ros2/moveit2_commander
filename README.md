# moveit2_python

## Description
python interface for moveit2 

Use Boost:Python to create a shared library from C++ for pyhton 

## Road Map
5/5 add conversion core
5/11
## How to use
1. colcon build
2. source install/setup.bash
3. ros2 run python_interface test_script.py

## Node
Only included conversion core by Boost:Python now.

So nothing will happen but launch a node named "moveit_python_wrapper".
